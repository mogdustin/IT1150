<h1><b> Dustin Kucinic</b></h1>
<p>In taking this class I am hoping to expand upon my knowledge of coding. I dont think HTML is something Iam going to be using often, but its a good knowledge to have.</p>

<p> I became interested in programming through my last job. it was just facinating to me that they were able to build a whole business system from scratch. Ive always been a problem solver and it seems that essentially thats what coding is. </p>

<p> my Goals is to get a job as a software engineer. Eventually I would like to work for Nasa as I think that would be a really cool job.</p>

<p> to work at nasa is a dream goal and eventually get into teaching.</p>
